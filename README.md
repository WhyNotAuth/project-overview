# WhyNotAuth

WhyNotAuth is a totally free and open source oauth2 and openid connect service and management tool.
The goal is to allow people to build complicated authentications and authorization scenarios with a free
tool.

More details to come in the future, including architectural diagrams of the MVP. This particular repo will
be for project level documentation and issues.
